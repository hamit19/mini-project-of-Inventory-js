This is a practical mini-project of the Inventory App. I've used HTML, Tailwindcss, and OOP JavaScript to implement the mini-project.  

The features of the app:
1. you can create a new category.
2. you can register a new product by the category you want.
3. after registering your product it will add the list and it will have the details such as registration date, the category label that you have chosen, quantity label, and delete button. 
4. you can also search in the list of products that you made.
5. you can sort the products by oldest or newest.
